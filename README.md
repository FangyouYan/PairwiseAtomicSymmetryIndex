# Project introduction
Pairwise Atomic Symmetry Index (PASI) is a topology-based method to quantify the symmetry relationship between any pair of atoms within a molecular structure.
# File structure (pairwise_atomic_symmetry_index)
- atomic_symmetry.py : The main program file containing the core logic and algorithm implementation for computing PASI.
- test.mol : A sample molecular file used to test and demonstrate the functionality of the algorithm.
# File structure (molecular_dynamics_simulation)
- molecular_dynamics_simulation.zip : : A compressed archive containing files related to molecular dynamics simulations, including input and configuration files.
